The abstract should summarize the content, methods, results, and conclusions of the thesis (project). Formulas, tables, and figures should generally not be used in the abstract, and reference numbers should not be cited. A Chinese abstract should be approximately 300 words, while a foreign abstract should be approximately 250 words.

Keywords are subject terms used for search queries. They should be general technical terms that cover the main content of the thesis (project) (referring to relevant technical terminology standards). Keywords should be selected from the Chinese Subject Headings List (HSL). Important terms in new disciplines and technologies not included in the HSL, as well as names of regions, individuals, and documents, may also be used as keywords. Keywords should generally be 3-5 in total, arranged according to the level of their extension (with the most extensive keywords appearing first). Keywords should be placed below the abstract in a different font size than the main text. Multiple keywords should be separated by semicolons. Chinese and English keywords should correspond one to one.
